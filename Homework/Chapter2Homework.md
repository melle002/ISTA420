  1. A local variable is is a varable that exists only in a method or other small section of code.
  2. A statement is a command that performs an action.
  3. An Identifier is the name you use to identify the elements in a program.
  4. A variable is a storage location that holds a value.
  5. A method is named sequence of statements.
  6. Yes. Primitive types and value types are the samething with the exception of string.
  7. The operators that can be used depends on the value types
  8. There is no provision for converting an integer to a string 
  9.  .NET Framework provides a method called Int32.Parse to convert string values to an integer.
  10. Precedence governs the order in which an expression's operators are evaluated and Associativity 
  is the derection (left or right) in which the operands of an operator is evaluated.
		Precedence ex: 2+3*4 //3*4 is evaluated first which results in 12 then 2+12 yeids final result of 14
		Associativity ex: 4/2*6 //4 is divided by 2 which results in 2 then 2 is multiplied by 6 which yeids final result of 12
  11. The definite assignment rule states you must assign a value to a variable before you can use it.
  12. In expressions using prefix operators the expression is evaluated before written and 
  expressions using postfix operators are executed after it is written which returns initial value of the variable first.
  13. String interpolation is used for concentrating stings. It also allows you to generate string values that include variable values,
  14. The var keyword causes the compiler to deduce the type of variables from the types of expressions used to initialize them.
